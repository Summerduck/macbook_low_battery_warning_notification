macbook_low_battery_warning_notification

This is a Python script that checks the battery level of your MacBook and displays a notification if it falls below a certain threshold


You can automate this script to run at regular intervals using a cron job if you're on a Unix-based system like MacOS or Linux. Here's how you can do it:

Open the terminal.
Type crontab -e to open the cron table for editing.
Add a new line that specifies when to run your script. For example, to run the script every 5 minutes, you would add:
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/script/battery_check.py
Replace /path/to/your/script/battery_check.py with the actual path to your Python script.
Save and close the file.
This will set up a cron job that runs your script every 5 minutes. You can adjust the interval to whatever you prefer by changing the */5 part of the line. For example, */10 would run the script every 10 minutes, */30 would run it every 30 minutes, and so on.

Please note that the path to Python (/usr/bin/python3) might be different on your system. You can find it by running which python3 in the terminal.
To get the path to Python on your system, you can use the which command in the terminal. Here's how you can do it:

Open your terminal.
Type which python3 and press Enter.
